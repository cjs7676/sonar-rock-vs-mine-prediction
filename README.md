# 📘 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction 🌊⚒️  

## 🚀 Overview  
Welcome to the **Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction** project! 🎉 Using the power of **Machine Learning** and **Logistic Regression**, this application determines whether a given sonar signal represents a **rock** 🪨 or a **mine** 🏭. The sleek **Streamlit** interface ensures an engaging and user-friendly experience!  

## 💡 Features  
- 🧠 **Accurate Predictions**: Harness the power of Logistic Regression for binary classification.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Results**: Upload sonar data and get instant predictions.  
- 🖥️ **Streamlit UI**: Interactive and visually appealing interface for seamless usability.  
- 🎯 **Practical Utility**: Helpful for underwater exploration and related fields.  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `sonar_app.py` 🐍: The main Streamlit application.  
- `model.py` 🤖: Code for training the Logistic Regression model.  
- `data/` 📊: Folder containing the sonar dataset.  
- `requirements.txt` 📄: All required Python libraries for the project.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Streamlit** 🌐  
- **Logistic Regression** 📉  
- **Sonar Dataset** 📊  

## 🚦 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
- To open the Jupyter Notebook for exploration, use:

  `jupyter notebook`

### 2️⃣ Set Up the Environment
- Create a virtual environment for dependency management:

  `python -m venv venv` 

### 3️⃣ Install Necessary Packages
-Activate the environment and install required libraries:

  `pip install scikit-learn`  

  `pip install pyarrow` 

  `pip install numpy`  

  `pip install pandas` 

  `pip install streamlit pandas numpy`  

### 4️⃣ Run the App on a Web Page
 1. Navigate to the virtual environment:

  `cd venv `  

  `cd Scripts `

  `.\activate.ps1 `   

 2. Run the Streamlit application:

  `streamlit run sonar_app.py `  

 3. To stop the application:

  `ctrl+c`  

 4. Deactivate the environment:

  `deactivate`  

## 🎨 User Experience
- Intuitive interface with clear instructions.
- Eye-catching emojis 🌟 for a fun and interactive feel.
- A prediction button that reveals the result dynamically.
## 🏁 Results
- Rock Detected 🪨: "This is a ROCK! Perfect for nature's collection. 🌱"
- Mine Detected 🏭: "Alert! This is a MINE. Stay cautious! ⚠️"
